# KMSAuto

This utility operates based on Microsoft’s Key Management System principles, introduced after Windows 10. The KMS was designed for large companies with multiple computers in their workplaces.

This approach simplifies activating each device. Companies purchase a KMS server that automatically updates their computers with the latest key every 180 days. By using KMS Auto Net, some system files on your device are modified, making it function similarly to a KMS server.

It shares similarities with the Microsoft Toolkit but includes additional features. For example, it provides a feature for generating license keys for both Windows and Office. It is an alternative for those who prefer not to use a traditional Key Management System.

## KMS Auto Net Features

**Dual Activation**

A standout feature is Dual Activation, supporting both Microsoft Office and Windows. The tool works seamlessly with 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, making it a versatile option for quickly obtaining licenses for your products.

**Generate Keys**

Another notable feature is the ability to generate product keys for Windows and Office. This allows users to create keys without installing a KMS server. It’s a secure choice since it avoids setting up a server, eliminating potential security risks.

**Lifetime License**

Although many licensing products exist online, most are unreliable or temporary. KMS Auto Net offers a permanent licensing solution, whether through key generation or KMS technology. However, KMS requires an internet connection every 180 days to maintain activation; otherwise, it deactivates.

**Genuine License Status**

One of the reasons users prefer this tool is its ability to provide a genuine license status. This ensures that your system receives Microsoft updates, which protect against viruses and other threats while eliminating the need for manual updates.

**Free Of Cost**

Despite offering these robust features, KMS Auto Net is entirely free to use. There are no limits to the number of devices that can be activated, allowing unrestricted use across multiple machines.

**No Virus**

Rumors about KMS Auto Net containing viruses or malicious code are entirely false. The tool has been thoroughly tested for safety. However, to ensure authenticity, always download it from the provided official link.

## Install & Use KMSAuto Net

The key part of this guide is installing KMSAuto Net to activate your license. If you’ve reviewed the details above, proceed with the steps below.

Before installation, temporarily disable Windows Defender or other antivirus software. This is crucial as such tools often block utilities like KMSAuto Net, automatically deleting files upon extraction.

To disable Windows Defender or antivirus software:

- Right-click the antivirus icon in the taskbar.
- Select `Exit`, `Turn Off` or the equivalent option.
- Proceed to extract and install KMSAuto Net to activate your machine.
- This process ensures smooth installation and immediate licensing.
