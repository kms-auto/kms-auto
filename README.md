# KMSAuto
This tool is also working on the principles of Microsoft’s own Key Management System that were introduced after Windows 10. So, this KMS was introduced for more prominent companies having various computers in their office.

In his way, activating each machine is quite different, so they now buy a KMS server that automatically installs the latest Key to their computers every 180 days. Using KMS Auto Net also modifies some system files on your machine, and it appears this is also a part of that KMS server.

This is quite similar to the Microsoft Toolkit but has some other features. Even though it also offers a feature that is used to generate the license key for both Windows & Office. It is used alternatively for those who don’t want to use the Key Management system.

## KMS Auto Net Features

**Dual Activation**

The first thing that should be highlighted is the support of Dual Activation, which means it supports both Windows and Microsoft Office. Even though it can be used on both architectures, whether 32-bit or 64-bit, you can use this single tool to get the license for products and architecture in no time.

**Generate Keys**

Another part I like is the generation of Windows and Office Product keys. This feature allows users to generate keys instead of installing a KMS server. It is the best option as it doesn’t install any server, which means no security breaches.

**Lifetime License**

Since various products are already available on the internet to get a license, none is trustworthy or permanent. But by using the KMS Auto Net, you can get a permanent license whether you use the Key or KMS technology. However, KMS requires internet after 180 days. Otherwise, it will be deactivated.

**Genuine License Status**

The thing why most people prefer this tool is because of its genuine license status. That means when you get the license with this tool, it also allows you to receive updates from Microsoft. It is pretty remarkable because this way, we don’t need to install the latest version manually, and it also protects us from viruses and other trojan attacks.

**Free Of Cost**

Now you might wonder if providing these features will cost some money. to provide are wrong as it is entirely free of cost. There are no limitations on how many devices can be activated using a single tool, so feel free and use it on an unlimited number of machines.

**No Virus**

There are several rumours that the KSMAuto Net contains some virus that steals their files. I’m afraid that’s not right and false, as this tool has no virus or malicious code. I have tested it before uploading, so make sure to only download from the link we provided.

## Install & Use KMSAuto Net

So, the central part of this article is how to install KMSAuto Net and use it to get your license. You are ready to go if you know everything about it and have read all the above sections. Otherwise, I would recommend reading the above section first and then coming here.

Ok, before we move to the installation section, we have to disable Windows Defender or any other Antivirus tool from our computer. It is a highly recommended step; otherwise, when you extract the zip file, it will delete all contents instantly.

As I already told you, these applications block these sorts of tools, which is why they immediately remove them without asking. In this way, make sure todisable it. However, you can read the below steps to disable Windows Defender.

But make sure to turn off your Antivirus as well, and you can do it by right-clicking on the taskbar icon and then clicking exit, turn off, or whatever option you see. After this, you will be able to install it and get the license for your machine instantly.
